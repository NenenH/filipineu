this mandarin fish tastes as if it were caught a year ago .
this meat is as tough as leather .
i told you i wanted it well-done .

well , the chicken is overdone .
you have been ignoring us all evening .
i am certainly not paying the service charge .
it is very noisy in here .
our table was in a very poor position .
would you like it cooked a little more ?
it is warmer here .
perhaps you would prefer to sit in the middle of the room ?
there is less draught .
what is the problem , ma'am ?
would you like me to send it back ?
would you like something else while you are waiting ?
i will return your chicken to the chef .
i will check your order with the chef .

good evening , sir .
would you like to order some wine with your meal ?
um , yes .
the wine list , sir .
thank you .
you certainly have a very extensive cellar .
what would you recommend ?
i think that chablis or a muscatel would go very well with your oysters .
we would like one which is very dry .
then i would recommend the muscatel .
we will take a half bottle of that then .
and with your steak ?
let us see , do you have a very full-bodied wine which is not too fruity ?
our own house wine which we import specially , the chateau de lescours , would be very suitable .

we will have a full bottle of that .
certainly , sir .
just a moment , please .

what is a doggie bag ?
it is a bag with a picture of dog on it , but everybody knows we are taking the food for ourselves .
how much should we give the waiter as a tip ?

what is the problem ?
i cannot understand how you have worked out such a big bill . it comes to $ 127 .
could you tell me how you added up the items ?
one moment , please . i will check it .
the waiter goes to the cashier and returns with a bill in hand .
look , sir , eighty-seven dollars for fried prawns and grilled lobster .
please break it down for me .
all right . that is , fifty-eight dollars for the fried prawns and twenty-nine dollars for the grilled lobster .
is that right ?
exactly . what about the rest ?
yes , 6 dollars for red caviar and ...
just stop here . i did not order any red caviar .
i would like to go over the bill myself .
looking at the bill
and i did not order this fried ox kidney , either .
sorry , i will ask the cashier to check it up again .
the waiter goes to the cashier and returns .
i am awfully sorry . the cashier miscalculated the bill by adding the bill on the other table to yours .

excuse me , sir . do you mind putting these outside the restaurant or giving them to me and i will certainly take good care of them ?
no , i do not like to leave my personal belongings with others .
i will finish the dinner as quickly as possible .
they will not get in the way .
( a polite smile on his face )
but your umbrella is a bit too long and it might bump onto others or knock over the dishes .
if so , it may spoil your dinner .
is it your privilege to ask me to do so ?
it is not my privilege , but my duty .
our restaurant maintains a good reputation . we have a good clientele here .
we will keep a good eye on your things and return them to you immediately when you have finished your dinner .
a smile appears on his face .
i do not think i will refuse your kindness .
thank you .
excuse me , could i be of any help to you ?
yes . my wife and i had dinner here just about one hour ago .
we were in a hurry to catch the train for the trip , so we finished the dinner very quickly . then we hurried to the railway station .
but my wife suddenly found her gold watch missing . i wonder if you could help us find it .
do not worry . what is the watch like and where did you put it ?
we did find a gold ladies' watch when we began to clear the table . wait a second , please !
the waiter goes to the main desk and returns with the watch in his hand .
is this yours ?
yes , that is it .
we really do not know how to thank you .
the watch was a wedding gift from my grandfather . it is very special to me .
taking out some money
please keep it .
oh , thank you very much . but i cannot accept it .
it is my pleasure to do what i can for the guests .
wish you a safe journey !
giving a message to a guest
excuse me , i am expecting a friend but he has not arrived .
i wonder whether he has left a message for me ?
may i have your name , please ?
yes , it is smith .
and your friend's name please ?
white .
a moment , please . let me check for you .
yes , mr. smith .
mr. white called to leave a message for you fifteen minutes ago .
what did he say ?
he said he was delayed by the meeting , and he was going to meet you at 1 o'clock . and he apologized for keeping you waiting .
i see . thank you for your information .
i am expecting a friend but he has not turned up yet . did he leave a message ?
what is your name , please ?
it is carter . c-a-r-t-e-r .
just a moment , mr. carter . let me check the message notes .
you are expecting mr. forest , are you not ?
yes , that is right .
what did he say ?
he said that he had something urgent and had to contact you as soon as possible . and he asked you to call him back when you have arrived .
it that all ?
that is all he said .
where is the public telephone , please ?
it is over there .
gavin , you forgot to bring the knife and fork .
could you tell me where to get them from ?
it is in the big box .
anything else i need to take ?
do you have paper napkins ?
well , that is all . you can join the line .
the formal banquet
( people are at the banquet room . the waiters are carrying large trays with aperitifs and canapes . )
what are the drinks for the banquet today ?
royal salute , dubannet , sparkling cider and martinis .
and also very good rum punch .
yes , it is very good .
but we would like to have the banquet hall decorated .
it would be better if a christmas tree stands in the middle with some colourful streamers .
no problem . and look at the waiters , please .
they all look neat and clean .
they are all wearing tuxedo jackets and a bow tie .
and they are all wearing white gloves .
yes , i have noticed that .
what are on the menu for the main course ?
they are snails in garlic butter , guinea hen under glass with wild rice , braised endive , heart of palm salad , and croquembouche .
french cuisine sounds marvelous .
and please have a centerpiece for every table .
certainly .
and what would you like to order for the soup ?
vichyssoise , please .
yes . i wish you a good night .
could you bring me some cigarettes , please ?
which brand would you prefer ?
i would like salem menthol , please .
i am afraid we only have lark regular or mild in stock , sir .
well , make it regular then .
certainly , sir , but i am afraid they must be paid of separately .
can you not just put it on my bill ?
i am afraid we keep a separate record for cigarette sales .
well , how much are they ?
$ 9 , sir .
here you are then .
excuse me , sir . your cigarettes and change .
waiter !
this meat is raw !
i told you i wanted it well-done .
sorry !
i will tell the chef and serve you another one .
there is too much salt in the soup , too .
i am sorry , i can change other soup if you like .
then , i would like cream soup .
all right , i bring it to you in no time .
the bill you sent me is incorrect , waiter !
oh , dear . what is the matter , sir ?
i was overcharged $ 9.90 for the meal .
overcharged ?
it is very strange .
yes , it is the second time .
really ?
i must apologize if that is true .
you asked to see me , mr. brown ?
yes , i did .
i am very upset with the way i have been treated .
could you tell me what exactly is the matter ?
my steak is too rare . i cannot eat it .
but when i complained to your waitress , she just ignored me .
i am very sorry , sir . she does not understand english very well . she should have changed your steak .
but she did not .
it has been a misunderstanding , sir .
i will have the steak returned to the kitchen right away .
that is more like it .
is that it , sir ?
yes .
well , i hope you enjoy your dinner .
i will try .
what happened to my order ?
i have been kept waiting for over half an hour already .
i am very sorry , sir .
i will check on it right away .
well , please hurry up . i cannot wait much longer .
i have a train to catch .
one moment , please .
i am sorry to have kept you waiting , sir .
your order will be here in a minute .
oh , here is your order .

this is not what i asked for , i am afraid .
oh , i am so sorry .

yes . what i ordered was roast beef .
waiter , may i see you for a moment ?
what is the problem ?
is this my meal ?
what did you order ?

just a minute , and i will get your order for you .
waiter , could you please come over here ?
what can i do for you ?
i would like to change the soup you gave me .
why ?
what is wrong with it ?
look , there is a fly in my soup !
it wasn 't there when i served it to you .
well , there is one now .
if you do not change this , i am going to make a scene .
alright . just relax . i will take care of it .
seeing the guest beckoning to him , the waiter goes over .
is there anything the matter , sir ?
yes , have a look at the shrimp . it is stale .
oh , i am awfully sorry to hear that .
such a thing seldom happens in our restaurant because we always get fresh shrimps from the market every day .
i will go to the kitchen and report it to the chef .
that is no use at all .
i do not have enough time to wait for it .
i am terribly sorry . do you mind trying something else ?
do you mind trying something else ?
then bring me a steak .
remember to have it well done this time . i do not have time to change this and that .
i am sure we will satisfy you .
you better this time .
the waiter goes to the guest with another shrimp .
please try the shrimp this time .
why , i have cancelled it . but still i will try .
yes , this is good .
the chef said this is well done and the above one is medium .
but in fact they were the same batch of shrimp today .
and he also asked me to tell you it was on the house .

just one minute , please .
he brings the bill and the guest looks at it carefully
would you mind explaining this to me ?
what is item 6 ?
of course not .
maybe i could go through it for you .
number 1 is the cover charge .
the second item is the beer .
then your starter , your main course and the vegetables .
the main course was 36 baht and not 33 baht .
so item 6 is the difference .
oh , i see .
but how was i expected to know that ?
yes , madam .
they are a bit difficult to follow sometimes .
the seventh item is your second beer .
number 8 is your dessert and item 9 the cigarettes .
and how about the service charge ?
is that included ?
yes , that is marked down here , 10 % service .
now , can you take my credit card ?
i am afraid we do not accept credit cards .
i am sorry to hear that .
what about a check with a bank 's card ?
waiter !
the bill , please .
very good , miss .
could i sign the bill ?
if you have got the key card of our hotel , yes .
here is the card .
would you please wait for a moment while i telephone the front desk to check ?
all right .
sorry , miss .
the front desk tells us that you have completed your check-out procedures . so the key card is no longer available .
please pay the bill in cash .
i am awfully sorry .
how much do i owe ?
ninety baht .
here is one hundred baht .
the change is for you .
thank you just the same .
thank you for coming . you are most welcome to call again . goodbye .
can we have our bill ?
certainly , sir .
how would you like to have your bill , one bill for three of you , or a bill for each ?
a bill for three of us , please .
by the way , what currency do you accept , us dollars or renminbi ?
either will do .
the bill is made out in renminbi . if you pay in us dollars , we will convert renminbi into us dollars against today 's exchange rate .
i see .
here is your bill , sir .
it is three hundred eighty-seven baht .
please have a check on it .
wow !
nearly four hundred baht for a single meal ?
if you wait a minute , gentlemen , i will go over the details .
you had one shark 's fin soup . that is eighty baht . fried sea crab meat is one hundred baht . this eighty-eight baht is for fried prawns . there are also roast beijing duck , vegetables and your drinks . the service charge is also included , of course . 
i think the charge is reasonable .
let me have a look at it . all right .
here is 400 baht .
just a moment , please . here is the invoice and change , twelve baht .
i hope you enjoyed your dinner .
see you next time .
could i have my bill , please ?
certainly , sir .
she brings the bill .
i am afraid there has been a mistake
i am sorry , sir .
what seems to be the trouble ?
i believe you have charged me twice for the same thing .
look , the amount 17.50 baht appears here , then again here .
i will just go and check it for you , sir .
she returns a few minutes later .
you are quite right .
the cashier made a mistake .
i think you will find it correct now .
thank you .
we do apologize for that , sir .
that is right . no harm done .
now , can i pay by traveller's checks .
yes , you can , sir .
we will give you the change in baht if you do not mind .
you need not worry about that . there will not be much change out of $ 30 .
so you can keep the change .
that is very kind of you , sir . but there is no tipping in thailand .
i am sorry . i did not know that .
you see , i just got in town yesterday from boston .
no tipping ?
that is good .
but just for curiosity 's sake , how can you survive without tips ?
just as everybody else . you see , we are paid the same monthly wages as everybody in the restaurant .
i see .
the reason i was wondering whether you could make a living without taking tips is that in my county waiters and waitresses are paid a much lower hourly pay than people with jobs without tips .
they expect the tips from guests to make up the difference .
if they do not get enough tips they will not be able to make a living .
and do they usually get enough tips ?
they do most of the time .
they generally make pretty good money .
that is good .
i will go to the cashier 's counter to settle the bill for you .
please wait for your change .
thank you .
helping a guest to look for a lost article
excuse me , sir .
yes , madam . what can i do for you ?
i have lost my handbag .
oh , when and where did you lose it ?
i am not sure .
i think i took it to lunch at the restaurant and forgot to carry it with me when i left .
do you remember which table you were at ?
it was a table for two near the window . but i am not quite sure of its number .
would you wait a minute , madam ? i will check it for you .
that is very kind of you .
i am sorry , madam . i have checked but did not find it .
could you describe your handbag ?
how big is it ?
and what is its color ?
it is new black leather handbag , about 50 centimeters long and 30 centimeters wide .
what is in the bag ?
there is a purse with about rmb2,500 in it , a credit card , my passport , a camera and some other things .
well , would you write down your name , address , and telephone number ? i will inform the security department to take care of it .
we will let you know immediately when we find it .
thank you very much !
hello , mrs. condon ?
yes , speaking .
this is mcdonald 's restaurant . your handbag has been found . you left it in the lavatory .
could you come to the security department and take it back .
oh , it is wonderful ! you are really helpful . thank you very much .
i just do not know how to express my gratitude .
it was nothing , mrs. condon . we are glad to be of your service .
how did you like the meal ?
oh , it will not do at all .
i am sorry to hear that . what is the problem , sir ?
first , it took us too long to wait for our courses to be served .
i am sorry , sir . we are terribly busy . but we will try to improve it next time .
and the chicken was overdone . it was as tough as leather .
i am awfully sorry . i will get you another one , if you like . that would be on the house , of course .
no , i do not want it any more .
then we will not charge for the chicken . please accept our apologies .
that is all right .
i assure you that we will try our best to improve our work and everything will be all right again next time you come .
all right . i think i will come again .
waitress , there is no ashtray on the table .
we are sorry , sir .
smoking in public places is forbidden by the regulations set by our municipal government .
if you want to smoke , please go to the lounge .
i do apologize for causing inconvenience to you .
i see .
in this case , i will restrain myself from smoking .
by the way , this glass is cracked .
i am really sorry i did not notice that .
i am going to change it right away .
could i have some toothpicks , please ?
certainly , sir .
i will bring you some .
look what you have done !
the soup is spilt on my clothes .
i am terribly sorry , sir .
i will bring you a cloth immediately .
hurry up !
we have booked a table for eight .
the reservation is under the name of johnson .
yes , one moment please .
i am afraid there is no table reservation marked under that name , sir .
but i myself called just this morning and i was promised a window table .
i see .
there must be some mistake , sir .
we could give you a nice table in the blue room , though . i am afraid it is not a window table .
well , i suppose we will have to manage with that , but i must tell you i am disappointed with your service .
i am very sorry indeed that this should have happened , sir .
but i assure you we will make every effort to make your evening here a pleasant one .
there is no ashtray on the table !
i am very sorry , sir . i will bring you one .
could i have some toothpicks , please ?
i will bring you some .
is it you that asked to see me , ma'am ?
yes , i am very annoyed .
could you tell me what is the matter ?
my fried chicken is too hard to eat .
when i complained to your waiter , he just ignored me .
i am very sorry , ma'am .
his english is very poor .
he ought to replace your fried chicken .
but he did not .
i will take the food to the kitchen at once .
that is more like it .
anything else , ma'am ?
that is all .
a guest hard to deal with
i wonder how you cooked the meat . it is just like old leather .
i cannot chew it. it is hard enough to break every tooth .
sorry , sir . let me take it back and change a new one for you .
no , just set it aside . i think you will do more harm than good .
i would like to change the order . bring me a ham steak instead .
waiter , look what you have done .
you spilt the broth over my dress . it is terrible .
i am very sorry , ma'am .
perhaps i can soak it up with a sponge and with a little warm water ?
no , you are not a laundryman . you will only make it worse .
i want to speak to the manager .
i do apologize for this unfortunate incident , madam .
i think if you would take the trouble to have it dry cleaned , do send the bill to us and we will pay for it .
or if you do not mind , we can have it cleaned and ironed in our laundry .
just forget it .
we do not want to put ourselves in trouble . but i would like to say it leaves much room to make guests satisfied .
thank you for your good advice . we will certainly improve our service .
complaining about the unsatisfactory service
waiter , i want to have a word with you .
yes , sir . is everything to your satisfaction ?
satisfaction ?
i do not know how you can think of such a word .
no , far from that !
i wonder if you could give me another word ?
we have been kept waiting here for almost half an hour and we do not know how long we will have to wait before you can bring us the first dish .
i am sorry about that .
we have more guests than usual today . furthermore , one of our waiters did not feel well just an hour ago and asked for leave . but i will see to it at once .
do you mind if i ask the wine steward to serve you some drinks first ?
oh , one moment , please .
i have to say that the tablecloth is a disgrace .
look , it is covered with soup stains .
it seems that is has been here for ages .
oh , i am sorry , sir .
it should have been changed earlier .
change it with a new table-cloth at once .
excuse me , i will be with you in a minute .
i am sorry to have kept you waiting .
now please take your time and enjoy yourselves .
is everything all right , sir ?
how much longer are we going to have to wait for our steamed fish ?
i am so sorry , sir . we are terribly busy . but if you wait a minute , i will see whether our chef has got it ready .
i am sorry , sir . your steamed fish is not ready . if you do not really want it , we can cancel it .
okay , cancel it then .
please do accept our apologies and be assured that we will do our best to improve our service . i am sure everything will be fine when you come next time .
all right . i will come again if we get a chance .
thank you for having been with us .
look , these two plates are spotted !
i am very sorry , ma'am .
i will replace them right away .
and this glass is cracked !
i am awfully sorry , sir .
i will change it for you right now .
look what you have done !
the soup is spilt on my suit .
i am awfully sorry to have stained your suit .
i will bring you a cloth immediately .
yes , be quick !
are you a hotel guest ?
we will arrange for your suit to be cleaned at once .
could you accompany me to your room to change there ?
all right .
may i have your room number , please ?
yes , it is # 1234 .
after you , sir .
we are very sorry to have caused you this trouble .
yes , it is real nuisance .
could you change clothes , sir , and give me the wet ones for cleaning ?
hang on a minute .
may i have your name , please ?
yes , it is wilson .
how long will it take to get them cleaned ?
i will need my suit tomorrow .
we will deliver your suit by twelve noon tomorrow .
could you get it done a little sooner ?
i am afraid our laundry is closed now .
well , i will just have to wait then .
we are very sorry for the inconvenience , sir .
your tables are ready , this way please .
good morning , thanks for being ready for me .
may i know what would you like to order first ?
do you have any lemon juice , the fresh ones ?
would you like some ice in it ?
i would not like any juice with ice in the morning .
anything else ?
two toasts and a cup of coffee .
is it time for breakfast ?
we serve breakfast from 6 : 30 to 9 : 30 in the morning .
what would you like to order ?
i would like to have the continental breakfast . it will save some time .
and what kind of fruit juice would you like to have , sir ?
i wonder what kinds you have .
we have all kinds of them , orange juice , strawberry juice , pear juice , and so on .
i would like a bottle of strawberry juice and two rolls .

are you ready to order now ?
we would like to try some chinese food today . could you give us any advice about it ?
with pleasure .
chinese food is varied . we serve guangdong cuisine and sichuan cuisine .
what is the difference between them ?
guangdong food is usually a kind of seafood . sichuan food is a sort of food with more seasoning . and it tastes a bit more spicy than guangdong food .
then i think guangdong food sounds nice to us .
all right , would you like to look over the menu first .
you can find the list of guangdong dishes on the left . you can decide on what dishes you would like .
i will be back in a minute and take your order .
thanks a lot . you are so considerate .
we would like this course for two , please .
i am afraid this course is for four persons .
well , cannot you make it for two only ?
i am afraid not , sir .
this course is for a minimum of 4 to 5 persons and i think the portions will be too large for two .

i am afraid not , madam .
our licensing laws are quite strict .
nobody under 18 years of age is allowed in a bar .
it is the same at home , but we thought since they are on holiday , it will not be any harm .
we will not order them anything strong .
maybe they will just dance a bit .
it is our last night in thailand .
i am really sorry . i would like to oblige , but you see my difficulty .
maybe no one will notice .
well , it is also our duty to check , madam .
now how about a drink in the lounge outside ?
if you sit here , you can see the band and hear the music as well .
but no dancing , huh ?
regretfully not .
you are only doing your duty .
it is a hotel policy , sir .

i am sorry to have caused you so much trouble .
no trouble at all .
this is the hot towel for your hands .
thank you very much indeed .
it is a pleasure to be of your service .

we are here in a restaurant famous for its chinese food .

it is chicken soup .
at a restaurant that serves cantonese guangzhou dishes , we usually start off with soup .
this soup is delicious .
what is the second course ?
it is ' sweet and sour pork ribs ' .
it is very popular with our foreign friends .
i also like it ; it tastes good .
do not you like seafood , mr. brown ?
i can manage shrimps all right , but i am afraid crabs do not agree with me .
here comes the ' steamed fish ' .
according to the menu , there are ' stir-fried rice ' , ' spring rolls ' , and ' dumplings ' .
which do you prefer ?
i think i will try the dumplings .
now we will end with some fruit .

i will buy the tickets .
all right .
here are your tickets .
thank you .
it is a new park , is not it ?
yes , it was opened last year .
in the evening at about 7 o'clock , a drama will be staged at the theatre in the park .
oh , i am afraid it will be a hard time for me .
i cannot understand a single thai word .
do not worry , it is a dance drama .
the characters in the drama will dance throughout the play .
the aside will be spoken in english and thai .
so you need not worry about the language . i think you will have a good time this evening .
that is great !
look , this is the famous world trade centre .
it is huge , is not it ?
yes , it is .
would you like to go to the top and have a bird's eye view of the city ?
why , of course .
where can we take the elevator ?
this way , please .
oh , we are in the sky .
the view is so breathtaking .
i have a friend who lives somewhere near the city .
we can ask him to be our guide and go with us .
it would be very good if he could go with us .
i have never seen a beach as crowded as santa monica .
people of all professions and age groups come here every summer on weekends .
it is a time for fun and relaxation .
that is an important part of the modern american life .
they like to go to the beach in summer , especially people who live in big cities .
these vacationers come here with their friends or families .
would you please do me a favor ?
yes ?
could you take a photo of me here ?
certainly .
thank you .
what shall i do ?
this is an automatic one . you press this button .
all right .
step forward a little . say cheese !
thank you very much .
not at all .
i have never expected the eiffel tower to be so magnificent .
it is pity we have not got enough time to visit it today .
it is one of the single most recognizable structures in the world .
it weighs about 7,000 tons but exerts the same pressure on the ground as average-sized person sitting in a chair .
that is a miracle , indeed .
it was designed by alexander eiffel , was it not ?
you are quite right .
his fame rested mainly on his iron bridge .
he was also the designer of the statue of liberty .
really ?
he was something .
the tower is 1,056 feet high .
on a fine day you can see it from some 40 miles away .
i did not know that .
of course , i have included it in my itinerary .
to see it best , you should go through it step by step .
how ?
you can visit the tower in three stages .
first , you can take the elevator to the first landing . there , you have a view over the rooftops of paris .
and then you come to the second landing . the second landing provides a panoramic view of the city .
the third and final stage give the most spectacular views . you should better not go to the top landing directly .
i see .
what can i see within the tower ?
there is so much for you to see .
for example , on the third level , you can look at eiffel's office .
in the office you can see wax figures depicting the engineer receiving thomas edison .
that is fabulous .
tomorrow morning i will get up early and go there first .
but the tower will not be open until nine .
what a beautiful view !
it sure is .
the grand canyon is truly a masterpiece .
no man could ever make anything like this .
what is that below ?
it is the colorado river .
you can go down the river in a boat if you wish .
it looks a bit too dangerous for me .
there is a beautiful state park here .
i can see why so many people come out here to camp .
there is this beautiful view , you can go fishing , camping and also enjoy this beautiful clean air .
it definitely is a nice change from the polluted and crowded city .
ok . here is lake itasca , the true source of the mississippi .
yes .
help me take down the canoe , and our exploration begins .
but the river at that point is only about ten feet wide . we can get into trouble there .
maybe . this is true exploration .
thank heavens ! we passed it safely .
look ! the disjointed stone bridge is blocking our way .
i think we have to pull the canoe out , beat a passage through the prickly brush , and carry the canoe around to the stream below the bridge .
the river loops back and forth around itself . it is tripled or quadrupled the distance to our destination .
do not worry .
the river will leave the swamp and straighten soon .
oh , great !
here , we have reached the bemidji lake .
the river becomes a great stream 200 feet wide .
we begin a 400-mile delightful canoe trip tomorrow morning .
have you visited niagara falls ?
several times .
it has become a tired old tourist sight .
but if you look over it from an airplane , it becomes something completely new .
really ?
yes .
you should realize that niagara falls is not tired ; only the way we look at it is tired .
you are all right .
for the ground tourist , the approach to niagara is flat , and since an industrial area has grown up around the falls , they are surrounded by concrete , asphalt and a strong chemical smell on both the united states and canadian sides .
only a stretch of lawn and trees reminds us of the wilderness that once was there .
can we see it clearly from above ?
of course .
so , i think we should visit it again .
thank you very much .
you are welcome .
the tourist is at the scenic spots now .
he is with a tour group whose tour guide is li jun .
let us get off the bus , ladies and gentlemen .
this is zhangjiajie .
we can take some time to go around .
please go back to the bus at 4 o'clock .
what a beautiful scenery !
it is really a nice place .
the mountains have gradually eroded to form a peculiarly spectacular landscape of peaks and huge rock columns rising out of the forest .
there are waterfalls , caves , streams everywhere .
this place is unique .
this is jiangjun cliff . on the right , it is yuanyang waterfall .
oh , look at the people there !
they are dressed differently .
oh , they are people of the minority group tujia .
this area is home to three of the province's minority peoples-tujia , miao and bai .
these minority groups continue to speak their languages and maintain their traditional culture .
ah , i see .
on the way up , there is a jumping fish pool .
it is so beautiful .
did you enjoy yourself ?
yes , i had a great day !
it is nearly 4 o'clock now . we would better go back to the bus .
all right , let us go .
what are the best places to visit here ?
it depends .
if you are interested in the city , you might like to tour it by car .
i can be your guide .
we will leave the afternoon free .
you can do some shopping in the shopping mall , if you like .
great .
what do you suggest we see ?
i suggest we visit the metropolitan museum of art first .
now let us go .
look , people are jogging along the river .
here we are .
the exhibits are really special .
i enjoy the paintings very much .
this is broadway .
there are lots of theaters .
this way leads to times square .
every new year's eve , thousands of new yorkers and visitors welcome in the new year here .
and we should not miss seeing greenwich village , a little west of washington square .
now we are just coming up to london bridge . next , we are coming to the tower of london .
oh , splendid .
what a sight !
look !
the water of the lijiang river is so clear and pure .
yes . the reflections of the hills in the water looks so real , and the farmlands spread out like green carpets .
fantastic !
i feel as if in a wonderland .
the landscape in guilin is characterized by its green hills , clear water , pretty rocks and grotesque caves .
i hear it is a fascinating experience to visit the caves .
as planned , we will visit some famous caves , right ?
yes .
in the caves you will see splendid stalactites , stalagmites , stone curtains and flowers .
they form various fascinating sceneries .
there !
the hill looks like an elephant .
i remember seeing it somewhere .
it is the elephant trunk hill . it looks like an elephant drinking water with its long trunk .
what a beautiful sculpture of nature !
look at those bamboo rafts over there with men and big birds .
the birds are busy catching fish .
the birds are trained cormorants .
the boat is going faster now .
yes .
pretty soon we will see the huashan hill .
what is special about it ?
it is another wonder along the lijiang river .
seen from some distance away , the different shades in color on the cliff appear like a herd of horses .
please let me know when we are there .
you can count on it .
as for the palace , i think the grandiose building facing down the mall is neither old nor attractive .
in fact , the palace's best facade , nash's long garden front , only can be enjoyed by those invited to one of her majesty's garden parties .
but how about us ?
we have to wait .
wait ?
yes .
when the trees are bare , we can see it from the top of the double decker bus heading down gloucester place .
what a pity !
but you can also get a glimpse of nash's architecture by visiting the royal mews in buckingham palace road .
really ?
yes , it is also designed by nash .
you went to disneyland yesterday , did not you ?
yes , i did .
how did you like it ?
marvelous !
everyday people arrive there in a stream of cars and buses .
i have never seen such a crowded and charming resort .
among these visitors , which is the biggest group ? children , adults , or old people ?
disneyland attracts people of all tastes and all income groups , and people of all ages , from toddlers to grandfathers .
what are the attractive features of disneyland ?
the main attraction of the magic kingdom is a place of excitement and thrills for everyone .
how long would a visit take ?
that depends on how much you want to see .
you should have a map in hand so that you always know where you are .
what part of the visit excited you most ?
a stereoscopic film ' grand canyon ' .
that is really a special attraction .
can you tell me something about disneyland ?
sure .
are you going to take a trip ?
that is right .
i will visit there with my wife for a couple of days .
i have been there only once , but i will tell you what i can remember .
when did you go there ?
that is quite a few years ago .
i stayed there for two days .
did you see much ?
i just visited some important places .
you cannot see all of the amusement park in one day .
how big is the park ?
about 180 acres .
it has five main sections . they are named main street , frontier-land , fantasy-land , tomorrow-land and adventure-land .
disneyland is often called the " magic kingdom " .
there are so many things to see in the park .
what did you enjoy most ?
jungle river boat safari , sleeping beauty castle walkthrough , submarine voyage and tom sawyer island . i think , are all fascinating .
it sounds like you had a wonderful time .
yes , it sure was a happy and memorable experience for me .
i am sure you will enjoy your visit too .
they are now in the park .
look !
that is the famous parade of walt disney characters .
wow !
snow white and the seven dwarfs ... this is a true fairyland .
look who is coming !
oh mickey mouse and donald duck . lao li , i would like to have a picture taken with them .
okay .
get ready . cheers .
great !
one more !
all right , one more .
now shoot this one for me .
the one i took last time was blurred .
i will take three shots for you .
so do not move .
one , two , three . there must be a good one .
now let us take the jungle cruise .
such a long line !
it will take ten to fifteen minutes , but it is really worth it .
what is the cruise about ?
you will soon find out for yourself .
( at the exit of the cruise . )
oh , it is truly hair-raising !
was it not worth it ?
oh , of course .
that is another experience i can boast about when i am back in china .
i was also scared to death the first time i took the cruise , but i still liked it .
people like to scare themselves sometimes .
i agree .
well what is next ?
after such a horrible experience , i would suggest something sweet and romantic .
what about snow white and the seven dwarfs ?
let us go .
it is a lovely day , is not it ?
yes , it is . it is a lovely day for an outing .
what places of interest are you going to show us today ?
we will go to splendid china first and then to safari park .
splendid china ?
yes , it is a park . it features all the man-made and natural wonders of china in miniature .
oh , i see .
this park allows us to tour the whole of china just in one day .
oh , that is great !
look !
the great wall stretches right into the sea .
our forefathers built this wall to defend themselves from invasion .
that is why they had to make it so long , over mountains and across plains , from the land to the sea .
i see .
so the great wall was built for the sake of peace .
in that case , it should be called the " peace wall " .
that is not a bad idea , but it is a bit too late now .
you should have made this suggestion to the first chinese emperor long ago .
when would that be ?
you should have spoken to him about it in the qin dynasty , which was only a little over 2,000 years back .
i know i am not young any longer , but not as old as all that !
let us go up these steps !
it is a rather steep slope .
will you give me your handbag and hold on to my arm ?
as you know , westerners have completed many huge projects , but none of them beats this wall in scale .
the american astronauts saw it with their naked eyes from the moon , did not they ?
they saw a very small earth , and this long , long wall .
anyway , the western countries are advanced in science and technology .
that is why i am going to london to study electronics .
i hope you will bump into my daughter , rebecca , while you are there .
if you come across a muddle-headed girl , it may be her .
but there are so many students at london university ; it is not very likely i would meet your daughter there .
you never can tell .
it is a small world after all , just as what the astronauts saw from the moon .
perhaps you are right .
gosh !
where is my bag ?
it was in my hand a few minutes ago .
here you are , my dear clear-headed professor !
since you have visited yellowstone , could you tell me something about this famous national park ?
my pleasure .
the best part of yellowstone lies in the northwest of wyoming .
in 1872 , it became the world's first national park .
it is said that yellowstone is a wonderful land which has intrigued the minds of men , moved them , and inspired them .
the wonder , the mystery and the beauty of this plateau challenged the early explorers .
here in yellowstone were features of such significance that men were inspired to evolve a new philosophy for the land , a new land-use ethic based on preserving a part of the natural scene .
but to many , it is a fleeting glimpse of a geyser , a bear , or a canyon through the window of a passing car .
more than this .
when you visit it , you will find that yellowstone is more than a collection of scenic features and natural curiosities .
how do you usually spend your weekends ?
going to a disco or to a karaoke bar , because i like singing and dancing .
do you know anything about peking opera ?
tell me something about it .
peking opera is a combination of music , dance , art and acrobatics .
that sounds interesting .
how do they perform ?
all the actions , such as drinking , eating or rowing boats , are shown by the movements of the actors and actresses .
i think i should go and see it when i visit china next year .
how do you like the play ?
i do not like it .
it is hard to understand and it is boring .
i prefer straight-forward plays .
on the whole , the play is not satisfactory at all .
you are absolutely right .
i think the acting could be better .
to be fair though , both the costumes and sceneries are marvelous .
well i do not like the men's costumes , but the women's dresses are lovely .
who is the actor who plays the doctor ?
that is william bush .
i watched a drama in which he played the hero .
last month the troupe were putting on tour shows in shanghai .
i thought he did well .
i did not expect that he should have disappointed us today .
we would better go to a comedy next time .
i do not want to watch a tragedy until we have finished the journey .
i thought the musical comedy we saw last week before we started the trip was very good .
it was .
they had constant changes of scenes , and i love variety .
me too .
i hate to sit there and look at the same stage scenery one act after another . i was tired of that .
another reason might be that the lines are too difficult for us to understand .
sometimes body language is easier for foreigners to understand .
the charms of drama depend as much on the action as on the words .
i quite agree with you there .
we have a popular saying in our country : ' all work and no play makes jack a dull boy.'
we all believe that everybody needs recreation .
we cannot work all the time if we want to maintain good health .
you are quite right !
i think everyone has his own way of relaxing .
perhaps the most popular way is to engage in sports .
when i was young , i liked to play tennis in the summer as a recreation .
my favourite winter sport was skiing .
you also have a favourite sport , do not you ?
yes , my favourite sport is badminton .
sometimes , i also play table tennis , or go swimming .
many people enjoy sporting events , but they do not like to participate in them .
chess , card-playing , and dancing are forms of indoor recreation enjoyed by people old and young .
are you a good dancer ?
not quite .
at my age , i like jogging .
i think it is a very good form of exercise .
it is a pity i have not had much time for exercise lately .
i am afraid i am putting on weight .
that serves as a timely warning !
you must try your best to reduce weight .
my next stop is hollywood .
i think i will find out more about movies there .
have a nice trip .
goodbye .
do you often watch tv ?
i watch tv every day . it has become a part of my life .
what kind of programs are you interested in ?
i am interested in everything , news and weather , editorials , world sports , soap operas , even kids shows . they are all good .
then , you are really a tv fan , are you not ?
i certainly am .
this show seems too boring . how about changing to channel 3 ?
go ahead .
it is the beginning of a romantic story . it looks good .
the actress is a famous film star in hollywood , is not she ?
yes , she is . it is said her acting is outstanding .
then , let us watch it .
did you watch tv last night ?
i believe yesterday many people spent the night watching the finals of the world table tennis tournament .
it was very exciting , was it not ?
i was very proud of the chinese players . they won the championship .
so was i.
but contrary to predictions , the swedish team won second place .
as a matter of fact , they really did quite well , i think .
hello , bob !
hello , tony !
have you just been to the cinema ?
yes , i have .
did you go alone ?
no , i went with jane .
what is on ?
" gone with the wind " .
oh , it is an old film .
i have already seen it .
i saw it a long , long time ago .
it is a famous film .
yes , the acting and the story are excellent .
i enjoyed every minute of it .
according to the poster put up near the booking office of the cinema , another famous old film will be shown this coming sunday .
what is it ?
" the sound of music " .
oh , that is another famous film !
i saw it about 15 years ago when i was working in new york .
i would like very much to see it once again !
i have also seen it before .
i was deeply impressed by the story and the music of it .
shall we go to see it again together ?
that is great !
well , i will book the tickets for the both of us .
very good .
jack , please turn on the tv to see what is on .
yes , mum .
what channel ?
what is on channel 8 ?
a concert , mum .
what about channel 10 ?
news and weather .
what is on following that ?
do you have a guide ?
here it is .
helen , there must be something wrong with our tv .
we cannot get a clear picture on it .
i am sorry about that , alice . i do not know how to adjust it . can you ?
i cannot , either .
why not take it to the repair shop ?
i got it repaired three days ago .
then , i think your tv set is too old to repair .
perhaps .
how frightening , please turn off the tv , john .
why ?
i do not want to watch such horrible movies . they give me nightmares .
mary , they are just stories .
what do you think about this week's tv series ?
tell you the truth , i do not think much of it .
what is your favorite tv program ?
actually i like variety shows better .
i also like variety shows , but that depends on the host or hostess .
i agree .
if a host lacks humor , i would rather not watch .
what is on channel three at eight o'clock ?
the tv series ' a dream of the red chambers ' .
it is a satellite tv program .
what is it about ?
it tells us a tragic love story of jia baoyu and lin daiyu in ancient china .
it sounds like a chinese story of ' romeo and juliet ' to me .
the film ' gone with the wind ' will be on channel twenty tomorrow evening . vivian leigh is a very famous actress .
her performance is wonderful .
the actor clack gable is excellent too .
it is worth seeing .
do not miss it .
all right .
i will not .
i am so excited to attend a typical chinese concert .
so am i.
the first item is a chinese musical instrument ensemble , including such masterpieces as the night of spring flowers , river , and moon .
the night of spring flowers , river , and moon is one of the most wonderful pieces i have ever heard .
i am glad you like it .
it praises the picturesque landscape of china .
what else ?
the moon reflected in the twin ponds . that is an erhu solo . butterfly lovers . that is a violin concerto . and some other popular folk music and songs .
the chinese folk music masterpieces concert must be impressive .
how many kinds of traditional chinese musical instruments are there ?
i do not know exactly , but i am sure there are at least 300 kinds . they can be grouped into four categories : stringed instruments , plucked instruments , percussion instruments and wind instruments .
you must be proud of that .
a chinese wind instrument , called ' sheng ' was introduced to persia and later to europe .
i hear there are over 50 nationalities in china .
i think they each have their own unique music , do not they ?
you are right .
take the dai nationality for example . their taigu is terrific .
oh , the concert begins ... how wonderful .
what is that horse head-like instrument ?
that is the horse head fiddle of the mongolian nationality . its music is rather moving .
is there a solo of that fiddle ?
i am afraid there is not .
what a pity !
excuse me .
can i help you ?
i am a tourist from china . my name is zhang feiyue . you play the violin quite well .
thank you . nice to meet you .
my name is robert johnson .
call me robert .
i want to enhance my musical knowledge during the trip to vienna .
can you give me some suggestions ?
you know vienna is a city of music .
you might hear mozart , schubert , beethoven , strauss , or haydn at an opera house , a church , or an open-air performance .
i am a fan of mozart .
you have landed in the right city .
in this city steeped in musical traditions and institutions , you will not only be able to hear his music in the concert halls , but also visit the places in which he lived and worked .
i hear the mozart memorial is the place that musical lovers frequent .
yes , it is not very far from here .
you just walk along the street , turn right at the corner , then walk two blocks and you will be there .
walk along the street and turn right at the corner . the mozart memorial is only two blocks away .
that is right .
to a true viennese , a meal is not a meal without music .
many restaurants provide customers with wonderful music as well as terrific cuisine .
last night i did hear some first-rate musical performances at a restaurant called ' wiener ' .
wherever you go , you can enjoy the charms of music .
that is true . thank you for your suggestions .
i wish you a happy music tour in vienna . goodbye .
the symphony orchestra we are going to hear tonight is one of the best in europe .
the playbill says that the first selection is beethoven's symphony no. 6 in f major , commonly known as the pastorale .
are you familiar with this piece ?
no , i am afraid not .
there is a commentary about it in the program . you can read it if you like .
thank you .
there is the conductor .
the concert will begin soon .
i cannot stand modern music .
you mean debussy , ravel , and those composers ?
no , i mean new rock , jazz and the like .
why do not you like it ?
i do not know .
it makes me nervous just to listen to it .
how beautifully they played !
i enjoyed every minute of it .
me , too .
i had thought i would not understand it , but when i heard the music , i loved it immediately .
i reckon they played the beethoven best .
i agree .
what kind of music do you like ?
things like viennese waltz , folk songs , and country music .
i enjoy country music , too . it is a kind of american folk music , is not it ?
sort of .
i think it was a very good performance .
how about you ?
i enjoyed it very much too . i especially liked the piano concerto .
the pianist was marvelous .
i wonder where he studied ?
in russia , i think .
he has been giving concerts for over twenty years .
rock and roll has a strong beat .
to tell you the truth , i am not accustomed to this kind of music .
the acoustics are good in this hall .
yes , i think so , too .
did you attend the concert last night , robert ?
yes , i went with my friend david .
how did you like miss williams' singing ?
she sang well , i thought .
she sang a very melodious folk song , did not she ?
yes , a very charming love song .
what type of music do you like best ?
i like classical music best .
how about you ?
i have a special liking for orchestral music .
how do you like the rest of the programme at the concert last night ?
i liked the tenor solo fairly well .
the quartet was not half bad , either .
there was a special item on the programme - american popular music .
what do you say to that ?
american popular music does not appeal to me .
but , as far as i know , it is played all over the world and is enjoyed by people of all ages in many countries .
i wonder why it enjoys such great popularity .
the reasons for its popularity are its fast pace and rhythmic beat .
i confess that las vegas is beyond my imagination .
the whole world is brilliant !

yes , of course .
then , how many hotels are there in las vegas ?
i do not know , either .
i have never counted them .
now , what kind of gambling are there here ?
anything you like .
like roulette , blackjack , craps , baccarat , keno , slot machine and so on .
frankly speaking , i have never gambled before .
what is likely to be the most popular type of gambling that a beginner can enjoy ?
slot machines seem too easy ... well , how about roulette ?
you only need to put out your chips or cash on the number you will be at first .
how can i get those chips ?
the dealers can exchange your dollars for casino chips .
shall we go ?

this is a list of the songs that have accompaniment here .
do they use video cassettes or laser discs ?
laser discs .
that makes it easier to locate the songs that people want to sing .
do they have english songs here ?
the names here are all written in english .
they have ' yesterday ' here . that is a song by the beatles . i will try it .
just write the title of the song on that slip of paper . the host will come to collect it .
miss wang , would you like to have a try too ?
how about this one ' the way we were ' ?
i am a poor singer .
my voice cannot reach the high notes .
it does not matter . since they are using laser discs here , it is very easy to change the key . you can just ask the host to lower the key .
come on , miss wang .
all right .

if not , we can move to the front .
no problem . it is very good here .
look at the girl . she is stacking the bowls one by one very skillfully .

just like speaking english . we feel it is difficult , yet the americans use it freely .
what activities are we going to have tonight ?
we will go to see shows by the chinese acrobatic circus .

look at the flying trapeze acts . they are scary !
i am afraid the acrobats might fall to the ground .
do not worry about them . they are skillful acrobats , and what is more , they have safety ropes attached to them .
their job is very hard and dangerous . it is really breathtaking .
look at this program . it is fun and relaxing .
ah , the clown is doing a tightrope walk . he is making faces to the audience .
it is not an easy job , is it ?
this would also need a lot of skill .
what a special costume he has !
now , look at the girl who is building a pagoda of bowls .
this program won a gold medal in the international acrobatic contest in ltaly .
this is incredible .
what do you think of the programs tonight ?
the programs are typically chinese . the dance , the music , the costume , the art are so wonderful .
this circus gave me a sense of chinese culture .
i am glad to hear that .
we will go to see " chinese soul " tonight .
what is " chinese soul " ?
it is an acrobatic performance introduced by the chinese acrobatic circus .
ah , i see .
how are the programs ?
i hear that they are very nice .
many programs have won medals in the international acrobatic contests .
that is great !
clowns play an important role in a circus .
they make the circus lively and make people laugh .
look . here comes two of them .
what funny faces and costumes !
and funny performances .
this is quite a show .
ah , he pretends to be dead .
the other is pouring water into his mouth .
that is incredible . he poured a big barrel of water into his mouth .
what a big stomach he has !
no , he did not really pour the water into his mouth .
he poured it into a big plastic bag .
i see .
it is very interesting .
if you are interested , i would like to take you to a dance this evening .
i would love to go , but i am not very good at dancing , you know .
that is not a problem .
if i go , would you promise to help me ?
sure .
i will let you get acquainted with the place for a while , all right ?
all right .
i have never seen a disco like this before .
would you like to try this dance ?

we would better stop idle talk and get down to business .

mary , may i have the pleasure of dancing with you ?
sorry ! i am engaged for this foxtrot .
may i have the pleasure for the next waltz or tango ?
certainly .
may i invite you to dance ?
sorry , i am engaged for this tango .
may i have the pleasure of the next dance ?
sure .
let us do the disco .
i do not care much for disco dancing .
and i am too tired to move anymore .
all right , let us call it a day here .
ok .
i did not know you were such a good dancer , lin .
thank you for your compliment .
i learned to dance when i was in university in china .
but i have not practised for a long time .
i can see you are beginning to enjoy it .
it is a good thing i came out .
i have made quite a few friends here , too .
i think we have had enough fun for the day .
honestly , i have got to fight to keep my eyes open right now .
you were the center of attention tonight , you know .
really ?
all right , let us call it a day .
i hope you enjoyed as much as i did .
were you at the dance last night , jane ?
yes , i was , and i brought a friend from another school .
i did not see you there .
i was there , but there were so many people , and i did not stay very long .
it was a nice dance , was it not ?
yes , i enjoyed it very much .
i danced and danced until late into the night . the band played very well , did not they ?
yes .
the band , as i know , is mostly made up of students of our school , but the conductor is a professional musician .
as the new year's day is drawing near , we are planning a family dance party .
would you like to join us ?
i would be delighted to come .
bring your friends to the party .
yes , i will .
are you free this weekend ?
yes , i am .
what is up ?
would you like to go dancing with me ?
absolutely !
there is a dance in the cafeteria this evening .
would you like to go ?
it is free , you know .
it depends on whether i am asked .
well , consider yourself asked ! would you go with me ?
ok , but i have got to be back before 11 p.m.
shall we go dancing for a change this time ?
well , i am not in the mood for it . i have got two tests to prepare for next week .
you have got to give yourself a break once in a while .
i will go with you .
i am thinking of a new mask for tonight's costume dance .
that is a good idea .
have you ever been to an occasion like this before ?
this is the first time .
i can see it is going to be an exciting evening .
yes , i think so .
let us find a place and listen to the music first .
shall i get you a drink or something .
yes , please . i think i need it .
here you are .
how do you like the music ?
to tell you the truth , i am not used to this kind of music . it is too fast .
now the music has started , would you hold my arm ?
with pleasure . i suppose you dance a lot .
oh , no . to tell you the truth , i have not danced in a long time .
still you dance wonderfully .
listen ! there is your favorite music .
shall we go for one more round ?
i think i can manage one more .
you danced wonderfully tonight .
thank you for your compliment .
you are indeed an expert dancer .
thanks , i am glad you say so .
i think you dance a lot , do not you , mary .
to be honest , i am hopeless in this kind of thing . i cannot improve at it at all .
good heavens ! there is no improvement at all .
you dance wonderfully .
i am glad you say so .
but i can tell you dance often , too .
sometimes , but i have no feel for it . i never seem to improve .
you are too modest .
shall we call it a day , wang ?
i think so . people are beginning to leave .
would you like something to drink before we leave ?
all right . it is very kind of you to have accompanied me here tonight .
it is been a pleasure , and i must thank you for your patient coaching .
miss wang and mr. bush are talking about going to the theatre .
i think we should go to the theatre tonight .
what do you think , mr. bush ?
it is fine with me , but if the play is in chinese , i am afraid i will not be able to follow it .
no problem . i will be your interpreter .
i am thinking we should go and see a beijing opera .
would you like to go ?
oh , i would love to .
i have never seen such a performance , but you will have to explain to me what is going on stage .
o.k. , that is easy enough .
miss wang , i hear that the traditional beijing opera is governed by certain conventions .
i would certainly be grateful if you could tell me something about it .
well , beijing opera originated in the late 1700s . it developed from some local operas in anhui and hubei provinces .
now it has become a unique performing art that integrates singing , dialogue , acting and acrobatic combat .
the actors and actresses are also different from one another according to the characters they play .
there are four main groups of characters , namely the male lead , the female lead , the painted face and the clown .
i am still in a fog .
let me explain .
the ' male lead ' plays the role of an ordinary man ; the ' female lead ' plays the role of an ordinary woman ; the ' painted face ' stands for men with distinctly different looks and characters .
it sounds very interesting !
moreover , beijing opera can be roughly divided into the military plays and the singing plays .
do the actors fight with guns in military plays ?
in some modern military plays they fight with guns , but in older plays they fight with spears and swords .
' havoc in heaven ' is a typical military play .
i know this is a story about the monkey king .
but can you give me an example of a singing play ?
' interrogating hong niang ' is a singing play .
in a singing play , singing and acting play an important part .
i know nothing about ' interrogating hong niang ' .
it is a moving love story .
the actress who plays the part of hong niang has a beautiful voice .
now the opera is on at the people's theatre .
perhaps you will have no difficulties in understanding it .
it is time to go .
let us go .
would you like to go the movies , mr. hunt ?
what is on now ?
is there something good ?
look at the newspaper .
there is a western on at the people cinema . here it is .
the frontier .
i have seen it . are there any typical chinese movies ?
there are many .
do you care for a kung-fu movie ?
what do you mean by kung-fu , mr. wang ?
kung-fu is a kind of traditional chinese martial arts . it is different from boxing .
i see .
when i was a small boy , i watched a chinese television serial . there were many kung-fu shots in it .
perhaps the name of that serial was huo yuan jian .
i cannot remember .
it was wonderful .
i have not seen such movies in years .
i often watch romance or science fiction movies . and today i would like to see something different .
let us check the newspapers if there is such a film . here at the globe movie city a very popular film by the name of challenger is showing these days .
the box office of the movie is said to have broken the record of its kind in hong kong .
who plays the hero , a chinese or a westerner ?
of course , a chinese , zhou runfa plays the leading role .
i have never heard of him .
but he is very popular among the chinese . he is made a name for himself in hollywood too .
if you could only see some of his movies , you would like him .
when shall we see the movie challenger ?
here is the timetable .
it is up to you .
would you like to see the movie expectation ?
it is a new one , i suppose ?
you bet .
the heroine is played by nancy keller .
good .
she is my favorite star .
i must go and see it .
will you go with me ?
i will .
what did the review say about it ?
not too bad .
the critics in new york times said it was rather light , colorful and entertaining .
movie news gave it three stars .
but mind you , you cannot always rely on the reviews .
we will have a better idea after seeing it ourselves , do not you think so ?
i guess you are quite right .
i will get the tickets reserved at the box office .
why not call the box office to book the tickets ?
it can save you a lot of trouble .
but i do not know their number .
i suppose we can find it in some local newspapers .
let us look in new yorker . here it is . 287-3122 .
what time is convenient for you ?
7 : 30 suits me fine .
then just wait for me here , and i will come and pick you up at 7 : 00 .
thank you very much .
i will be expecting you .
goodbye .
shall we go to a movie tonight ?
that is a good idea .
what is on ?
gone with the wind .
what is it about ?
sorry , i have no idea .
i thought this movie should be a candidate for some film awards .
if i am not mistaken , it has already won an oscar .
really ?
i am not surprised . the camera work was very good and the scenery was beautiful .
i thought the acting was first-rate , too .
they are showing titanic .
can you tell me something about it ?
it takes place at sea , and it is a wonderful movie . do not miss it !
what is the name of the film tonight ?
the last emperor .
i know absolutely nothing about it .
what is it about ?
it is a story of a chinese emperor .
shall we go to a movie this evening ?
i would like to , but what will be on ?
an action film .
sorry , i prefer love stories .
would you like to go to a movie with me tonight ?
yes .
is it an american movie or a foreign movie ?
american .
then i would like to go .
have you seen ghost ?
i saw it a few years ago .
what did you think of it ?
it was outstanding .
how did you like the movie rain man ?
i thought it was very good .
which part did you like best ?
i guess the scene that captivated me most was when the two brothers were talking to each other .
i have not seen such superb acting in a long time !
if i were one of the judges , i would choose it as ' best film of the year ' .
the critics thought it was one of the best films in the past ten years .
i really enjoyed that movie !
this story was too sentimental .
to tell you the truth , i had tears in my eyes .
the part of the old man was well acted .
i just could not see the point of this movie .
the plot was simple .
it was just meant for entertainment .
but the music was splendid .
it had an all-star cast .
yes . and the leading actor and actress are both my favorites .
at first i thought it was going to be a drag , but then it really got better .
hello , jack !
hello , smith !
have you just been to the cinema ?
yes , i have .
did you go alone ?
no , i went with jane .
what is on ?
" gone with the wind " .
it is an old film .
i have already seen it .
i saw it long , long ago .
it is a famous film .
the acting and the story are excellent .
i enjoyed every minute of it .
according to the poster put up near the booking office of the cinema , another famous old film will be shown this coming sunday .
what is it ?
" the sound of music " .
that is another famous film !
i saw it about 15 years ago when i was working in new york .
i would like very much to see it once again !
i have also seen it before .
i was deeply impressed by its story and music .
shall we go see it again together ?
that is great !
well , i will book the tickets for both of us .
very good .
how would you like to go to a concert this evening ?
i would like to very much .

mr. stone has felt a slight pain in his back for a few days .
he goes to see dr. wang in the hospital .
good morning , mr. stone .
good morning , dr. wang .
sit down , please . what seems to be the trouble ?
well , doctor , i have had a dull sort of pain in my back for three days . and it got worse this morning when i was exercising .
where exactly is the pain ?
i cannot quite pinpoint it .
when i sit or stand in a fixed position for a long time , i feel a dull pain across my back .
but it does not seem to bother me when i am lying down or in a relaxed position .
when did you first notice the pain ?
about a week ago or so . i would been sitting for a long time , talking with a business acquaintance . when i stood up afterwards , i felt the pain .
do you remember straining your back in any way during the past two weeks ?
not that i can remember .
i played basketball a couple of weeks ago , but i do not think it could be that .
have you picked up or moved anything heavy ?
no , i do not think so .
all right . let me have a look .
could you take off your coat and shirt , and lie on the couch , please ?
you do not think it is pneumonia , do you ?
i will give you a check-up .
i cannot give you a definite answer until i see the results .
do you have any fever ?
how about your appetite ?
no , i do not have any fever , and my appetite is quite healthy .
now , breathe deeply and exhale slowly . once more , please . there is no respiratory murmur in your lungs . now does it hurt when i press here ?
no .
how about here ?
yes , that hurts .
was it a sharp or a dull pain ?
it was sharp , not the usual type of pain i have felt recently .
all right . you can put on your shirt and coat now .
what seems to be the matter , doctor ?
well , judging from the check-up , it may be a slightly strained muscle .
do you play basketball ?
i used to play quite a lot , but recently i have been too busy to play .
you said you played two weeks ago .
yes , that was the first time in a long while .
i think that is where the trouble stems from .
do you really think so ?
do you remember feeling stiff after that game ?
let me see . yes , i did feel a bit of pain in my back the next morning .
but anyone has sore muscles when he exercises for the first time after a long break .
yes , that is true .
but you might have hurt yourself during the game , and not noticed at that time .
so , what can i do about it ?
i will give you a prescription for some pills to relieve the pain , and you should stay off work for 3 or 4 days , and not lift any heavy objects .
you could try some massages .
it is usually quite effective at relieving pains like this .
there is a very good massage department in our hospital .
i heard there are a lot of top masseurs in china .
i would love to try it .
fine .
there is a well-known masseur in this hospital . i will give him a call and ask him to take care of you .
thank you very much , doctor .
good bye .
not at all . good bye .
what seems to be the trouble ?
i feel sick all the time .
any vomiting ?
no .
then i suggest you go to gynaecology for further examination .
what is the trouble ?
i have been losing sleep .
is it troublesome ?
it is getting more and more so .
i have been suffering from insomnia .
and i have got a ring in my ears , too
have you had much stress recently ?
you look rather pale .
i think i have caught a cold .
take these pills and try to rest as much as possible .
i would better take your blood pressure .
it is 180 / 120 . i am afraid it is a bit higher than the average .
anything serious ?
i think more vegetable and less meat is helpful for your health .
if your blood pressure goes up steadily , it will be dangerous .
doctor , what is this for , can you tell me ?
this will relieve your pain and ease this inflammation .
i see .
thank you .
remember , this solution is for external use only .
what is the matter ?
i have a headache and a sore throat .
how long have you had that problem ?
for about three days .
is there anything else that bothers you ?
i perspired a little last night .
and i am feeling dizzy now .
i think you have caught a bad cold .
what is her problem ?
she has been throwing up since yesterday evening .
she seems weak and she cannot keep anything down . she has a stomachache and a slight fever .
i see .
let me feel her pulse , and take her temperature .
now i would like to check her blood .
is it serious ?
she should rest for about a week .
i will prescribe some medicine .
is it necessary to follow a special diet ?
she should eat some light food .
in the consulting room .
what is the matter with you , mr. sun ?
i have a headache , a sore throat and a cough .
and i had a terrible stomach-ache early this morning .
open your mouth wide , please .
i just want to have a look at your throat . say ' aah ... '
aah ...
hmm , it is red .
let me examine your chest .
just unbutton your clothes , please . now , take deep breaths ... inhale ... exhale ... inhale ... exhale . that will do , thank you .
i will give you some pills and tablets and a cough mixture .
here is the prescription .
take the medicine every four hours .
i am sure you will feel better tomorrow .
now let me take an x-ray photo of your stomach .
follow me , please !
well mr. sun , what is wrong with you ?
my ulcer has been worrying me lately , and i want to know the result of the x-ray of my stomach .
do you have a pain in your stomach ?
yes , particularly after meals .
there was blood in my vomit yesterday .
do you often do it ?
no , i would never done that before .
i see .
let me see your x-ray result ...
( holds the negative plate against the light )
mmm ...
i thought so .
mr. sun , i am afraid you need an operation for the ulcer .
is it so serious ?
i am afraid so .
operation !
what about my heart ?
let me feel your pulse .
have you been weak lately ?
i get tired rather easily .
have you been losing any weight ?
i suppose so .
the mirror tells me that .
has anyone in your family got heart trouble ?
well , both my parents have high blood-pressure , and my grandfather died of a heart attack .
hmm ...
your heart is in a rather bad state .
i am sorry to say you may need another operation someday .
you mean i should have two operations ?
yes , very likely .
otherwise you will go on suffering from these complaints for the rest of your life .
let me think it over , doctor harrison .
when i have made up my mind , i will come again .
good morning , mr. lawson .
good morning , miss temple !
i have a bad toothache .
i want to see the dentist .
have you made an appointment ?
sorry , i have not .
is it very urgent ?
yes , it is . it is very urgent .
i feel miserable !
i feel an acute pain in one tooth that has a cavity , and the one next to it aches in sympathy .
i could not sleep a wink last night .
but you have not made an appointment .
can you come the day after tomorrow , that is , may 25th , monday , at 10 a.m. ?
i must see the dentist right now , miss temple .
i cannot wait !
but the dentist is fully occupied now .
let me go in and ask dr. green if he could spare you a few minutes .
dr. green said if you could come again this afternoon , at 3 o'clock .
that is too late !
can the dentist not see me now ?
i am afraid that he cannot , mr. lawson .
can you not wait till this afternoon ?
i can wait , but my toothache cannot !
what is the matter with you , henry ?
you look unwell , and your eyes are bloodshot .
i did not sleep a wink last night .
i had such an awful stomachache that i was on the point of calling for urgent medical aid .
however , after i took some soothing pills , the pain subsided .
how do you feel now ?
i feel much better now , but a feeling of nausea still persists .
is this the first time you have had stomach trouble ?
in recent years , i have had occasional attacks of indigestion after eating something my stomach does not agree with , but i have never felt such a great pain in my stomach .
that is a rare case for me .
it might have been an attack of appendicitis this time .
i do not think so .
my elder brother was once operated on for appendicitis , and he told me all the symptoms of this disease .
my case is something quite different .
i think you would better consult a specialist .
i must go to see the doctor at once .
i hope there is nothing serious .
do you feel short-winded ?
yes , sometimes i do .
do you have pain in your chest ?
regularly .
i have a bad pain right here .
go and have these tests , first .
here you are , doctor .
i am afraid you have an appendicitis ! this needs an operation .
doctor , my knees hurt , but i wonder what you can do about it .
rheumatism is often a chronic disease . i will prescribe some chinese herbal medicine for you .
will you use acupuncture on me ?
i will if it is necessary .
i feel ill .
what is the trouble ?
i have got a sore throat and it hurts to swallow .
i think you need a shot to relieve the pain first .
by the way , i advise you to give up drinking and smoking .
good morning , doctor . i feel a pain in my chest and have a bad cough .
that is the flu . i will give you some cough medicine and some antibiotics .
thank you , doctor .
doctor , i feel like vomiting , and i have no appetite at all .
how pregnant are you ?
about six weeks .
it is nothing unusual . take it easy . you will feel better .

i ache all over .
how long have you been feeling like this ?
ever since yesterday .
i am feeling rather out of sorts today . my belly hurts .
are your bowels regular ?
no .
i have had two more movements this morning .
there is a bad virus going around there and maybe that is the cause .
any pain here ?
yes , it is sharp pain but just off and on .
breathe deeply . does it hurt when i press your chest ?
yes , and it hurts much when i cough .
go and have your chest x-rayed .
you may have tb .
i hear a roaring sound in my ears and i feel giddy .
how long has this been going on ?
a week .
keep warm , drink plenty of hot water and get plenty of rest .
hello , doctor . i have had a bad cough these days .
please unfasten your jacket and shirt and let me listen to your heart and chest .
there is nothing to worry about . your heart and chest sound normal .
doctor , i have been having a constant headache these days .
how bad is it ?
splitting .
i advise you to have a brain scan .
i have a sore throat , doctor .
open your mouth and say ' aaah ' .
aaah .

doctor , could you tell me how to take the medicine ?

i hope you have a good rest .
do you mean this drug will clear up my trouble , doctor ?
no , not exactly .
what do you mean , then ?
i mean it will relieve your pain .
what is the trouble ?
i had to be out all afternoon yesterday on account of some urgent business although i had a cold .
when i came home after stopping for supper on the way , i had a headache and fever and a pain in the chest .
in fact i was in aches and pains all over , so i took some aspirin and went straight to bed . during the night my stomach began to ache and i felt like vomiting . i could get no sleep at all .
oh , let me see .
has the pain in the chest anything to do with the upset stomach ?
no , it has nothing to do with it .
let me feel your pulse .
open your mouth and let me see your tongue , please .
do you still have a stomachache ?
it is a little better than this morning , but it still aches .
undress and lie down here .
your throat is quite swollen . you have a touch of flu .
i will give you a penicillin shot .
there is nothing seriously the matter with your stomach . so you do not need to worry about that . i will give you a prescription . take the liquid medicine three times a day thirty minutes before meals and the capsules a half hour after meals .
now then , i must warn you against greasy food for a while . for two or three days eat only soft food such as soft boiled eggs , oatmeal , milk and toast bread .
after that you may eat what you like , but do not overeat for a while even if you have an appetite .
all right , doctor .
thanks .
i have got a sore throat and my chest hurts .

good morning .

hello , john !
where are you going in such a hurry ?
hello , tom !
i am going to the hospital to see the doctor .
oh , you look pale today .
what is wrong with you ?
i have been a bit under the weather for the last few days .
i find this changeable weather rather trying .
i think i have a bad cold , and i now feel a little bit feverish .
i am sorry to hear that .
how did you get the cold ?
i was caught in a heavy rain last sunday , and was wet to the skin , which brought on a slight chill .
so i suppose that was how i got the cold .
that is the quickest way to catch cold .
sometimes it is difficult to shake off a cold .
i would better go to see the doctor at once .
i think you will get over it soon .
i hope so .
thank you . goodbye !

what is the matter ?
i have a stomachache . i feel like throwing up .
do you have any appetite ?
not too much .
i threw up last night .
let me see you throat .
i will examine your temperature .
is it serious ?
well , i do not think it is anything serious .
that could be an upset stomach from overeating .
can i eat anything ?
please eat digestible foods .
tobacco , alcohol and coffee are bad for your health .
can i have medicine ?
take this prescription to the pharmacy .
thank you very much .

how is your appetite ?
i lost my appetite when i had the high fever .
but now , with the fever gone , i feel hungry again and eat with great relish .
do you care for fruit ?
i usually have some fruit after lunch or supper .
i think you have heard the popular saying ' an apple a day keeps the doctor away ' ?
that is a good piece of advice .
fruits are good for our health .
when shall i be well enough to be discharged from hospital ?
do not you worry .

the trouble is we will have to sleep under a bright sun .
that is why i do not dare have any tea or coffee , not before i fall asleep , anyway .

where have you been by plane ?
i have only been flying over the american prairies \ , the pacific ocean and yellow sea , and never over any mountains before .
this may prove to be quite an experience for you .
in case you feel sick and want to throw up , there should be a bag for it in that big pocket at the back of the seat in front of you .

one would think you would been an air-hostess or someone like that .
that jerk nearly tossed my orange juice to the ceiling .

there must have been an accident .
i guess i should have taken a different route .
what are you doing sitting in the car all by yourself ?
i am just killing time .
traffic was unusually light , so i came a little bit too early .
why do not you just go in , then ?
why do not you read it to fill the time ?
the traffic is pretty bad .
it is bumper-to-bumper all the way .
it is always like that during rush hour .
how long does it take to get to your office ?
approximately an hour .
how about getting back in the afternoon ?
about the same if you hit the traffic .
you spend so many hours every day on the road !
i think you should move closer to your office .
we are thinking about it .
why are you looking in the rear view mirror ?
i see a patrol car following us with its lights flashing . i think they just caught us for speeding .
i think they just caught us for speeding .
how fast have we been driving ?
you know the speed limit here is 55 miles an hour .
i think we are almost there .
do you want me to ?
get in the back seat and take a nap while i ...
my engine tends to overheat on a hot day like this .
looks like you are low on gasoline .
i should stop at the next service station for gas .
i see one over there .
we will stop there for a few minutes .
may i have a receipt ?
tianhe railway station , please . i want to catch the 12 . ? 00 train .

i will have to give you a lot of coins .
never mind .
why do you have to double the fare ?
this is my first journey here . i am not used to the currency yet .
never mind . have a nice trip !
the suitcases are quite heavy . we would better call a taxi .

i have to catch the eight o'clock train .

i need a receipt , please .
let me make one out .
here is your change and your receipt .
it is all right to give me the receipt .
how much should i give the driver as a tip ?
the tip is generally fifteen percent of the fare .
you should explain earlier .
look at the meter .
there must be some mistake .
that includes the 20 baht surcharge .
here is the change for you .
the fare is 78 baht .
that cannot be right .
are you trying to cheat me ?
you have to add 20 baht to the fare .
here is 80 .
what do you mean this is not enough ?
it is still not enough .
the tip , mister
i forgot about it .
this is the first time i have taken a taxi in thailand .
168 baht , please .
what ?
you are mistaken .
the meter says 148 baht .
you have to add 20 baht to the fare .
why is it like that ?
it is the rule .
did you read the sign in front of you .
it does not matter .
there is a sign explaining it .
let me take a look at it .
i think i get it .
all the companies have the same policy .
sorry about the confusion .
where do you want to go ?
what did you figure out about the cab fare ?
we figure out the fare by kilometers . the first 3 kilometers are 8 baht , every extra kilometer costs one baht .
you can read the kilometers travelled on the meter .
how long will it take to get to the place ?
that depends on the traffic .
it is not heavy this evening . we shall be there in 10 minutes .
can you make a stop in front of a flower shop ?
i want to buy some flowers for my friend .
there is a flower shop over there .
let us make a right at the next corner .
how much do i owe you ?
here is the fare , keep the change .
can you take me to the airport ?
can i help you with your luggage ?
i would rather keep this case with me .
i have got several bags .
i am not sure it they will all fit .
maybe we can put some in the trunk .
let me open it .
do you want my advice ?
what is up , miss ?
is traffic always like this ?
today is especially bad .
we are barely moving .
one of the lanes is blocked .
it looks like we are stuck .
what happened ?
there may be an accident up ahead .
two cars smashed into each other .
one of the cars was completely crushed . its driver was covered with blood all over .
how dreadful it is !
traffic will be slow for a while .
what is the problem ?
there may be an accident down the road .
there is a police officer directing traffic .
i see car crashes all too often .
what is the reason for so many accidents ?
pedestrians and drivers do not obey the traffic rules .
what places would you like to see ?
i really want to see the lumpang night market .
you will return home after that ?
where will you travel to ?
will you go home after your trip ?
we are moving so slowly .
traffic is really heavy today .
is it like this every day ?
from five to seven p. m , the streets are really crowded .
is there any way around the traffic ?
we can try another route .
doing that cannot be better .
we are going at a snail's pace .
it is a pretty bad jam .
i should have waited until after rush hour .
vehicles ahead are moving faster and faster .
do not tell me it is this way every day .
for mornings and evenings , this is normal .
we are moving so slowly .
it is because of a big construction site .
it is no wonder that the traffic jam is this serious !
there is a crane ahead that dangles a large concrete pipe .
damned traffic !
there is an accident .
that red car smashed into that black truck .
let us hope nobody was hurt .
traffic has completely stopped .
what is going on ?
i see a crash at the next intersection .
a bicycle rider was knocked down to the ground , apparently seriously injured .
i hear an ambulance .
car accidents are common in thailand .
why is that ?
some motorists do not drive carefully .
i appreciate your driving skills very much .
accidents happen all too often .
how come ?
the traffic rules are not enforced .
a car accident again .
this is why the traffic paralysis happened .
do you see car accidents often ?
what is the reason for the many accidents ?
motorists do not obey the traffic rules .
it looks like we are stuck .
there was probably an accident up ahead .
people like driving fast and do not drive carefully .
what is it like driving a taxi here ?
sometimes it is boring . but , it can be stressful .
driving a taxi must be very exciting .
where to ?
saint paul hotel , please .
is it the one near the beach ?
get on . here we go .
could you send us downtown tomorrow morning ?
here is my company's business card .
give us a call whenever you need our service .
i will come for you at 7 : 40 .
shall we make it 7 : 30 ?
i do not want to miss the coach .
if i take the shortest route , we may come across a traffic jam .
if i take a less heavy route , it will save us 10 or more minutes , but you will have to pay more .
which do you prefer ?
are you sure that i can get here in time if we take the less heavy route ?
we can if we go at this speed and nothing unexpected happens .
how much more do i have to pay ?
compared to the shortest route , you may pay around 5 baht more .
that is acceptable .
no one wants to miss a train .
we will turn left at this cross . to go straight ahead is the shortest route .
is that luggage yours ?
let me put it in the trunk .
do i need to put the bag in the trunk , too .
would you please fasten your safety belt , sir ?
let me help you with the luggage .
can you make a stop at union square ?
i what to pick up my friend there .
how long will it take to get to union square ?
that depends on the traffic , you know . it is pretty heavy this afternoon .
can you make it in fifteen minutes ?
i am already ten minutes late .
where exactly is your friend waiting at that place ?
can you make a left at the next corner ?
can you slow down ?

how much do you charge ?
let me put this baggage here ?
where are you going ?
please take me to sheraton palace hotel .
how long does it take to the hotel ?
normally , twenty-five minutes , but today the freeway is terribly congested .
i am afraid it will take about double .
we will go through a toll booth . that will cost you extra fare .
is that the short route ?
put the small bags in the backseat .
could you help me load these luggage in the trunk ?
can we get around this mess ?
there is no other way .
traffic should speed up soon .

let me off at the next corner .
what a terrible traffic jam !
they are doing road works up ahead .
can we get around this mess ?
i will try a different way .
is there anything we can do ?
this is the fastest way .
a car with a flat tire is being handled by the traffic police .

things will clear up in a minute .
i am taking a short cut .
i do not usually go this way .
i know this area very well .

it all depends on what parts of the city .
we are now in one of the busiest parts of chonburi . there are jams nearly everywhere round here , and some jams last for hours .
i have got to get to the registry before they call it a day .
it is not rush hour yet .
i do not think this jam will last very long .
obviously the streets here are not wide enough for all this traffic . it is high time they were widened .
the traffic has begun to move again .
is this anywhere near n.w. 5 ?
you want to go to hillwood road , do not you ?
it is not very far from here .
but i am afraid you are going in the wrong direction .

we are moving so slowly .
traffic is really heavy today .
it is just the peak driving time .
we are going at a snail's pace .
they are doing road work up ahead .
it is heavy rain again .
what a terrible traffic jam !
there is heavy fog this morning .
it is a pretty bad jam .
do not tell me it is this way every day .
during rush hour , it is always like this .
we are barely moving .
one of the lanes is blocked .
the traffic is very often in disorder here .
traffic congestion again . please change to the freeway .
is it like this every day ?
it is too slow .
the trolleybus ahead cannot move because of power failure .
from five to seven p.m. , the streets are really crowded .
in the mornings and evenings , this is how traffic is .
a big tree ahead fell across the road .
oh , my god !
it is really a large open parking lot !
i cannot really stand such heavy traffic jam .
is there any way around the traffic ?
we can try another route .
can we get around this mess ?
i will try a different way .
how about the freeway ?
is there anything we can do ?
this is the fastest way .
there is no other way .
it is much often like this before the toll gate .
things will clear up in a minute .

the car driver is covered with blood all over .
i hope it is not serious .
the bicycle was completely deformed .
the bicycle rider suffered from serious injury .
that motorcycle was hit pretty badly .
let us hope nobody was hurt .
i see car crashes all the time .
how come ?
sadly , accidents are really common .
why is that ?
why are there so many car accidents ?
motorists do not obey the traffic rules .
some drivers always like exceeding the limit speed at the turn .
people do not drive carefully .
the traffic rules are not enforced .
some drivers like calling when driving .
what is wrong with your car ?
something is wrong with my car .
my tyre is damaged .
my taxi is having problems .
i am having trouble with my car .

you will have to take another taxi .
the brake does not work well .
now what ?
sorry , i have to ask you to get out here .
the oil pipe is leaking .
how long does it take to repair it ?
it would not be very safe to continue driving .
there is nothing i can do .
i can try .
how much should i pay you ?
pay as you like .
in that case , what is the fare ?
25 baht is fine .
it is not far . you do not have to pay me .
we just stared .

then , just make it 20 baht .
i hope you can fix the problem .
good luck with the car .
wish you have a good trip .

a single room for one night , please .
have you booked it ?
what kinds of single rooms are available ?
there are luxurious suites , ordinary rooms and economical rooms .
an economical one will do for me ; i am a student , you see .
but all the economy rooms are at the top of the hotel , on the 9th floor .
would it be o. k. ?
i think so .
there are lifts going up and down in this hotel , i suppose ?
there are two lifts at both ends of the corridor .
the higher up the room is , the better it will be .
you have said it , madam .
it is quieter there ; you cannot hear the traffic .
and i should think you get more fresh air up there .
is there a telephone in the room ?
sorry , there is not one , not in any of the economical rooms , but there is a fairly large black-and-white . t.v. set .
i will check in .
here is my passport ; when you do the registration , you can copy my name and all the other things you want to know from the passport .
it would save time .
mm ... i can see you are a very smart young lady .
but pardon me , madam , do you mind filling the blanks in the register-book yourself ?
i will check with your passport afterwards .
do not you think that would be even quicker ?
yes , perhaps that would be a quicker way .
it shows you are smarter than me , anyway .
thank you for your compliment , madam .
not at all .
there is yet another way : supposing you do the registering with the help of my passport , since you know what items should be entered in that big book , and let me do the checking afterwards , since i know more about myself than you do .
surely that is the quickest and the best way .
o.k !
you have won .
there is no need now .
i did the checking when you were copying from my passport .
now you see why i told you it would be the quickest way .
now i see why i am told the chinese are most clever .
here is your passport , and the key .
your room number is 918 .
you should better go up by the lift at that end of the corridor . it is nearer to your room .
do you want to be called up in the morning ?
yes , please .
just call me at 7 o'clock tomorrow .
what is the time for breakfast in this hotel ?
breakfast is served any time between 7 and 9 : 30 .
would you like to have breakfast in your room ?
you can have it sent to you , if you like .
i am sure it would cost more .
i would rather have my breakfast in the dining-hall .
where is it ?
it is on the ground floor .
you understand me , do not you ?
i mean this floor - that is the british expression .
but the americans call it " the first floor " .
we do the same in chinese .
anyway , the dining-hall is on this floor .
if you go to the other end of this lounge and turn to the right , you will find it .
the door faces the souvenir store ; you will not miss it .
i will come to check out soon after breakfast tomorrow .
now i must book a plane ticket before i go up to my room , as there is no telephone there .
may i use this one here ?
yes , do !
could you tell me the phone number of the booking-office ?
this is the airport hotel , so you only have to dial the extension number .
it is 101 .
i am calling because i booked a room for an overseas visitor . he will not be able to come now and so i will have to cancel it , i am afraid .
what name is it , please ?
and when was it for ?
it was a double room booked in the name of jackson from the twelfth for a week .
ah , yes , i have got it , from october 12 to 18 .
and now you want to change the booking , do not you ?
i wish i could , but it now appears that he will not be able to come at all .
i will cancel it then . i hope we can help you at some time .
i would like to cancel a reservation .
is the reservation for yourself or for another party ?
it is for my boss , dr. bob walter .
i will cancel dr. walter's reservation from july 12th for 2 nights .
we look forward to another chance to serve you .
i have reserved a single room for may 3rd . but a friend will come with me , so i want to change the reservation from a single room to a double room .
please wait a minute . i will check the room availability for those days .
we have a double available for may 3rd .
thank you very much .
i want to change my reservation .
what dates do you want ?
i would like to change the date from april 4th to april 6th .
ok , that can be arranged .
your luggage will be brought up to your room in a minute .
i am the attendant on this floor .
i hope i can help to make your stay a pleasant one .
here is your room 1015 . after you .
i hope everything is to your liking .
it looks lovely .
i am glad you like it .
i do like it .
by the way , is there a phone in the room ?
yes . all of our rooms have phones .
you can make idd calls from this phone .
if you need any assistance , please call the desk .
thank you . i shall .
do you have a laundry service ?
if you have got some laundry , simply leave it in the laundry bag in your bathroom .
it will be collected in the morning and returned the following morning .

breakfast is served from six thirty to eight thirty , lunch from eleven thirty to one thirty , and dinner from five thirty to seven thirty .
you can also buy mineral water , beer , wine , cigarettes and so on from the service counter on this floor .
i need to get some bahts .
where is the nearest exchange desk ?
we have a currency exchange desk next to reception on the first floor .

this is mr. kennedy in room 1212 . i would like to have some clothes cleaned . could you send someone to pick them up ?
i will send a maid up right away .
i am planning to check out tomorrow morning at 10 . will they be ready by then ?
we will be able to return them to you this evening .

all right , ma'am .
anything else ?
no , that is all .

what do you want for lunch ?
i would like to have two tuna sandwiches and a large pot of coffee , please .
please bring me some ice cubes and water .
here is the food you ordered .
just put them on the table over there , please .
yes , sir here are your sandwiches and your coffee . the sandwiches are 3 dollars and the coffee is 2 dollars . that comes to 5 dollars .
here is the bill .
can i have it charged to my account ?
would you sign here , please ?
excuse me . do you work here ?
i sure do .
can i help you ?
how do i use these washing machines ?
it is very simple .
the regular loads cost a dollar-fifty and each machine takes quarters .
oh , i should have brought some quarters . i did not think of that !
that is no problem .
we have a change machine right over there . you can get change for a one , five , or even ten dollar bills .
just insert the bill face up , and the machine will take it , and it will give you your quarters in change .
ah , just like las vegas , huh ?
any chance i would get more quarters out than i put in bills for ?
i would not count on it .
the washing machines are easy to use .
first , you select your temperature , add your laundry , then place your quarters in the slots , put it in right there , and that starts the machine .
that seems easy enough .
but what about the soap ?
watch the lights on the machine .
when the detergent light goes on , and detergent .
when the bleach light goes on , add bleach .
and just wait until the machine is finished .
where can i get detergent and bleach ?
we have a vending machine right over there that takes quarters .
you can get a box of detergent and a box of bleach for only fifty cents .
i really appreciate your help .
my pleasure .

how are you this morning ?
very well , but i am worried about my daughter . she's caught a cold .
i am sorry to hear that , sir . if there is something i can do , i am always at your service .
she will be fine , i suppose . she has taken some medicine .
but i do need help because my wife has lost her locket .
i wonder if she left it in the room . or maybe she dropped it somewhere in the hotel .
are you sure it is not in your room ?
i have already looked for it and have not found it .
i will call the lost and found department as soon as possible . excuse me for a short while .
sorry to have kept you waiting , mr. baker .
mrs. baker is lucky . someone found it in the corridor this morning . it could be the locket that mrs. baker lost . it has been sent to the housekeeping office .
wonderful !
you know , it is a gift to my wife for our anniversary ! thank you very much !
not at all . it is been a pleasure .
turn-down service . may i come in ?
come in , please .
how about tidying up a bit in the bathroom ?
we have just showered , and it is quite a mess .
i will place some fresh towels in there , and i will clean the toilet bowl , wash basin and tub .
the children have just played on the bed in that room , so please change our sheets and pillow-cases .
will that be all , madam ?
do you have a transformer for my husband's electric razor ?
and we need two more pairs of bath slippers .
madam , i go off at 10 : 00 p.m. would it be all right if i send them up through the overnight attendant who does the turn-down ?
ok . and i would like a hair-dryer some time tomorrow .
you have been so helpful .
i would like to have these documents typed and xeroxed immediately , because i need them for a negotiation early tomorrow morning .
no problem , sir . how many pages altogether ?
10 pages for each and i want 30 copies .
could you write down your name and room number and please sign here ? we will send the original as well as the other 30 copies back to your room .
oh , there is something more . i need to send a fax to usa . this is the main message .
is this the code number of the receiver ?
and shall i put in the code number of this hotel in case they want to send you a fax ?
thanks . but it is not necessary .
when do you expect to have it faxed ?
before 8 o'clock this evening .
what about the typing and xeroxing fees and how much should i pay for the fax ?
here it is , sir . right on the paper .
i appreciate you efficient service here .
would you please tell me the daily service hours of the dining room ?
from 6 : 30 a.m. till 12 : 00 p.m. serving nearly all day long .
does the guest house offer any other service ?
oh , we have a barber shop , a laundry , a store , telegram services , a newspaper stand , table tennis , video games and so on .

housekeeping . may i come in ?
when would you like me to do your room , sir ?
you can do it now if you like . i was just about to go down to meet my friends .
but before you start , would you do this for me ?
yes . what is it ?
please get me a flask of boiled water .
i need some boiled water to wash down medicine after breakfast .
i am sorry that your flask is empty .
i will go and get you another one that is full at once .
could you send someone up for my laundry , please ?
room 303 , smith .
certainly , mrs. smith . a valet will be up in a few minutes .
i also have a silk skirt which i do not think is colourfast . will the color run in the wash ?
we will dry-clean the skirt . then the color will not run .
that is fine .
when can i have my laundry back ?
usually it takes about 2 days . but would you like express service or same-day ?
what is the difference in charge ?
we charge 30 % more for express , but it only takes 5 hours .
would i get the clothes back this evening ?
all deliveries will be made before 6 o'clock .
i will have express then .
the room is too cold for me .
i feel rather cold when i sleep .
can you turn off the air-conditioning ?
the air-conditioning is already off , madam .
